# YouTube Auto Quality
This browser extension manages the quality of arbitrary videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). Users can define their preferred standard quality settings which is then automatically selected at the start of all videos.

## But why?
While watching a video on YouTube, user's bandwidth is analyzed in the background and the quality settings of the video are adjusted accordingly. While the majority of users do not experience any drawbacks, this process causes problems for a small group of users: Because of a faulty analysis, YouTube provides its videos to some users in a low quality even though the bandwidth is capable of handling higher levels of quality. As a result, these users have to set their preferred quality manually each time they watch a video. This extension aims to tackle this issue. Once users have defined an individual quality preference, this extension automatically sets the quality of all YouTube videos to this preference without the need of any user interaction.

## Setup
All major Chromium based browsers are supported including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, etc. To install the extension follow these steps:

1. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar. (If you use another browser than Google Chrome, you should be redirected you automatically.)
